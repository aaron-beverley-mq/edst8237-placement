## About
I am Aaron Beverley and have a long and varied career in Software Engineering working for Motorola, Canon, Optiver and The Trade Desk. Prior to this I was a scientist working for QML and before that a few part time jobs bartending, merchandising, warehouse work and at a bowling alley. I have 2 degree one from UQ with a major in Microbiology and Biochemistry and another from Griggith University in Information Technology. Over the past 20+ years I have gather some knowledge, managed some great people and made mistakes. I am at a cross road and have decided to head in a different direction and see if can apply my knowledge to teaching Software subjects in NSW Seconday Schools.
