## About
I am Aaron Beverley and have a long and varied career in Software Engineering working for Motorola, Canon, Optiver and The Trade Desk. Prior to this I was a scientist working for QML and before that a few part time jobs bartending, merchandising, warehouse work and at a bowling alley. I have 2 degree one from The University of Queensland with a major in Microbiology and Biochemistry and another from Griffith University in Information Technology. Over the past 20+ years I have gather some knowledge, managed some great people and made mistakes. I am at a cross road and have decided to head in a different direction and see if can apply my knowledge to teaching Software subjects in NSW Seconday Schools. I am part of the way through a Masters in Teaching (Seconday) and Macquarie University. My hope is that I can help the next generation with learning and understanding the craft of software development and technology. 

I have many hobbies, including gardening and have grown about 50 varieties of fruit and vegetables, I used to be a avid Ten Pin Bowler, I am always up for a grind in some open world PvE game, currently Helldivers 2 and when I have some spare time I tinker in my study with electronics,  code or 3d print.
