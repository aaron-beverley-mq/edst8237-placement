| 17/5 | SE      | Agreed to do a full lesson for SE rather than co-teach and included a review of the second assessment                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 18/5 | CT      | Gephi wasn't competed for CT so adjusted the schedule to include it on Monday, plus a review of diameter for graph theory as some students struggled with the concept. Included a diagnostic assessment in Mondays content to better gauge what students already understand about Computer Networks |
| 25/5 | SDD     | Taking on 2 extra lessons for SDD, denoted with :material-new-box: |
| 25/5 | SE      | Adjusting schedule to fit in lesson for the class to work on their assessment |
