| **Syllabus Outcomes:**<br> | - explains how structural elements are used to develop programming code [[SE-11-02]]<br>- applies language structures to refine code [[SE-11-08]] |
| **Lesson Outcomes:**       | - Be able to describe what is inheritance, generalisation and polymorphism<br>- Be able to apply these in python under the correct circumstances  |
| **Assessments:**           | Formative - Revision of previous lessons material via questions and working on todays task of converting text requirements into code              |

### Equipment / Resources

## Reflection
- What assumptions did I make when I planned this lesson?
- Were these assumptions correct/incorrect?
- What impact did these assumptions have on the effectiveness of the lesson?
- How could I do things differently next time?

| Pre-planning proved effective                                 |      |
| T&L strategies were effectively implemented                   |      |
| I was able to generate a sense of purpose                     |      |
| A high level of student participation was acheived            |      |
| My questioning was clear, concise and logically sequenced     |      |
| Pupils were interested and self disciplined                   |      |
| The resources used were appropriately graded                  |      |
| Instructions were clear adn easily understood by students     |      |
| I recognised and catered for individual differences           |      |
| I established and maintained an effective learning envirnment |      |

- What were the most effective elements of the lesson?
- What were the least effective elements of the lesson?
- If I was to repeat the lesson what would I change and/or improve?
