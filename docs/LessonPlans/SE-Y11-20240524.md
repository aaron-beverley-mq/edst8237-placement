## Reflection
- What assumptions did I make when I planned this lesson?
<br>I had assumed that the material had not been covered.
- Were these assumptions correct/incorrect?
<br>They we incorrect. The material had been covered so it was more like revision but with a slightly different explanation of the content. 
- What impact did these assumptions have on the effectiveness of the lesson?
<br>I needed to pivot a bit as some of the exercises had already been done so the students spent more time learning about CASE tools (diagram.net, smartdraw.net)
- How could I do things differently next time?
<br>Check and triple check to ensure content is not overlapping with previous lessons unless needed specifically as revison.

### Evaluation
key: S = Strongly Agree, A = Agree, N = Neutral, D = Disagree

| Evaluation                                                    | Mark |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Pre-planning proved effective                                 |   A   |
| T&L strategies were effectively implemented                   |   N   |
| I was able to generate a sense of purpose                     |   A   |
| A high level of student participation was acheived            |   75%   |
| My questioning was clear, concise and logically sequenced     |   A   |
| Pupils were interested and self disciplined                   |   Most were, a few were disruptive and on mobile or laptop doing other things  |
| The resources used were appropriately graded                  |   A   |
| Instructions were clear and easily understood by students     |   A   |
| I recognised and catered for individual differences           |   N   |
| I established and maintained an effective learning envirnment |   N   |

- What were the most effective elements of the lesson?
<br>The videos were effective but more effective was going over a worked example on the board after the video.

- What were the least effective elements of the lesson?
<br>Not all of the content was covered. We didn't finish a review of key concepts of OO that the students felt they needed a better understanding. This was partly due to disruptions in the class. We will cover the content in the next lesson.Only watching the video was another mistake. I should have worked through an example on the board of the DFD before the students did the exercise

- If I was to repeat the lesson what would I change and/or improve?
<br>I would ensure that I give worked examples on the board of both DFD and Structure Chart. I hadn't planned to do either, but when I could see the students starting to lose focus during the second exercise I saw an opportunity to change it up and work through the example. 

- Other items of note:
<br>There was a request from some of the students to work on the assignment in the next lesson. After talking with the ST we agreed that next lesson we will give time after finishing the content from this lesson. I've thought over this a bit and I think I would do this differently if I had the chance. My preference would be to run office hours (maybe once a week) during lunch for students in my classes to come and ask questions and work on assessments. This could prevent the class falling behind on material and not disadvantage those who were on top of the assessment by them not spending a lesson waiting for others to catch up.
