| **Syllabus Outcomes:**<br> | - manages and documents the development of a software project<br>- applies tools and resources to design, develop, manage and evaluate software |
| **Lesson Outcomes:**       | Describe the process of design used to develop code in an OO language                                                                           |
| **Assessments:**           | Formative: Activities used to reinforce concepts of writing user stories and top-down or bottom up design                                       |

- Laptop

### Key / Foundational Ideas
- How to write user stories, break a problem into logical units of work from either a top down or bottom up approach.
- Understand what design patterns are and how a fa√ßade works
- Learn about the ilities of Software Engineering
