| **Lesson Outcomes:**       | Develop a deeper understanding of the search and sort algorithms and can answer typical question on them for the HSC                                                              |
| **Assessments:**           | - Formative: Test the understanding of search and sort algorithms                                                                                                                 |

### Equipment / Resources
- Projector
- Laptop
- Pack of cards to use as a differentiation to give those who have difficulty understanding the algorithms on paper to have a physical representation of the same information.

### Key / Foundational Ideas
- Search and sort algorithms are used in software development and understanding linear and binary search along with insertion, selection and bubble sort provides fundamental knowledge

| Provide the link for the questions in google classroom. Walk the room helping the students<br><br>Test includes a variety of levels of challenges for the different abilities in the class. From Parson problems to deeper thinking pieces where students need to interpret the code, debug and fix the solutions. | Work through the questions provided and submit once completed.       | 40min  |
| Walk the room and discuss progress on major work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Focus on progressing their documentation and code for the assessment | 25min  |

## Reflection
- What assumptions did I make when I planned this lesson?
- Were these assumptions correct/incorrect?
- What impact did these assumptions have on the effectiveness of the lesson?
- How could I do things differently next time?
