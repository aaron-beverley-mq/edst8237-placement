[AITSL](https://www.aitsl.edu.au/standards#engage-in-professional-learning)

### 6.1.1 Demonstrate an understanding of the role of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers in identifying professional learning needs.
See [Standard 7](./Standard7.md) TASK Understanding the setting

### 6.2.1 Understand the relevant and appropriate sources of professional learning for teachers.
#### Becoming Part of the School
During my time on placement I have shadowed my ST and other teachers. This has include PL sessions conducted by the school, faculty meetings, yard duty and bus duty. 

### 6.3.1 Seek and apply constructive feedback from supervisors and teachers to improve teaching practices.
See [Standard 2](./Standard2.md) Planning and teaching task

#### Critical Incidents
- Working with a student who has some difficulties with learning and seeing his passion and want to learn the material. They are very well mannered and a pleasure to talk with showing that although school may pose its challenges for them they take every day in their stride and keep trying. These are the students I find great enjoyment working with as although they may never be the best in the subject they show the most potential and growth when working with them, listening to them and giving them support and encouragement.

#### Effective Learning Strategies for EAL/D
*Describe processes for working with ESL and Community Language teachers.*

#### Effective Learning Strategies for Special Needs
*Describe processes for collaborating with other professionals and family members to identify learning outcomes for students which may be adjusted to meet their needs*

### 6.4.1 Demonstrate an understanding of the rationale for continued professional learning and the implications for improved student learning.
See [Standard 1](./Standard1.md) for Communication with teaching staff task.

#### Developing teaching resources:
Working with my ST, I have been fortunate to be able to try some different tools and techniques. Some of these like
 - stand ups (yarning circle)
 - quizizz
 - Computer Network game I "created"
 - Lesson feedback process with green, yellow, and red cards.
have been well received by the students and ST.

My ST has been generous in providing ideas/strategies/resources that I will be able to use in the future and the material I have been creating, due to the subject being new in the syllubus, I expect will be helpful for my ST and my future classes as well.
