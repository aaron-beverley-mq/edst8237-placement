## 1.1 Physical, social and intellectual development and characteristics of students

## TASK
Devise and implement a tracking system and record inidvidual student's learning.
!!! note ""
    My approach to this is to develop a class observation and tracking system called [Cradle](https://github.com/aaron-beverley-mq/Cradle.Client). As I will be teaching software engineering subjects the code will be made public for the students to see and understand some of the principles that they will be taught.
