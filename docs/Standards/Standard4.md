### 4.2.1 Demonstrate the capacity to organise classroom activities and provide clear directions.
See [Standard 2](Standard2.md) Plannng and teaching task

### 4.3.1 Demonstrate knowledge of practical approaches to manage challenging behaviour.
I have had multiple chances to manage student behaviour during my placement. All have been effective under different situations. 

I have in a class that I was observing with the Teacher's permission worked closely with one of the students being disruptive. By enganging with them and working on the activity together by giving them prompts around the expectations they stopped being disruptive and I had them focused on the task and completed the activity.

In group environments I have found that waiting patiently for the class to quiet has been effective with small gestures or standing in the eye line of the students talking having been enough to catch their attention and bring their focus back on task. It has also proved effective when if I here students talking while I am presenting something to them to stop and wait for them. They quickly stop talking when they don't hear me talking.

There has been one situation so far when I have had to remind a student that what they were saying was not appropriate and that if it continued they would receive a demerit.

### 4.4.1 Describe strategies that support studentsâ€™ well-being and safety working within school and/or system, curriculum and legislative requirements.
